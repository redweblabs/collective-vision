####A photo curating app for a collective vision

###About
collective/vision is a web app we've put together that builds up a cumulative view of a place, person or landmark by drawing thousands of images atop one another to create a never before seen image.

Using Flickr's REST API with JSONP, we search Flickr's API for any tags that contain the users search term. We then draw every image we find at 1% transparency on top of every other image we find so that no one image has a greater effect than another.
